# Personal portfolio website

This is the source code of my personal website ([live here](https://xtiandiaz.github.io), and deployed from a [separate repo.](https://github.com/xtiandiaz/xtiandiaz.github.io)), meant as both a **portfolio** and as a **piece of portfolio** itself; let's call it portfolio-inception!

## Tools

- The site is built with the [Vue 3](https://vuejs.org/) framework, using its Composition API, which in my experience is intuitive, reliable, and which suits perfectly the fundamentals of "atomic design".
- The styling is enhanced with [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/), which IMO is still an extraordinary way to compartmentalize and reuse styles (even beyond the marvels of modern CSS).
- [InkScape](https://inkscape.org), [Krita](http://krita.org) and Figma, to produce (or remaster) the portfolio's visual content and the website's assets.
